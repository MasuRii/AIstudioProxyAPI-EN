Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/main' into merge-upstream

Resolved conflicts in browser_utils/initialization.py:
- Ported local enhancements (Auto-Auth Rotation, GlobalState integration, robust shutdown waiting, network interception fixes) to the new browser_utils/initialization/ package structure (specifically core.py and network.py).
- Deleted the obsolete browser_utils/initialization.py file to adopt the upstream refactoring.

This merge preserves all local functional improvements while aligning with the upstream codebase structure.
